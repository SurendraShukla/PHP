##### this
The **pseudo-variable** `$this` is available inside any class method when that _method is called from within an object context_. <br /> 
`$this` is a reference to the calling object (`usually the object to which the method belongs`, but possibly another object, if the method is `called statically` from the context of a `secondary object`).
